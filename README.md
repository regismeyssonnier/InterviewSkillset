# InterviewSkillset

Code that is asked in a **_`text interview question`_**.

Many question are given in an interview and some questions required some specifities included in the code.

By example, how we form the **`template`**, what is a **`shared_ptr`**, how many class can extend a **`class`** ??? .. etc.

Each langage have a file InterviewSkillset with their extension. Theyr maybe have some include files with them to work correctly.
